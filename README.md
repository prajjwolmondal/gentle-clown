# Welcome to Gentle Clown üëãüòÅ

This is a project to re-create an old app ([JokeMachine](https://github.com/prajjwolmondal/JokeMachine/tree/master)) using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev).

My target audience for this app is my fianc√©, so the jokes are all what I think she'd find funny.

## Roadmap

1. ~~Create OneLineJoke component which will return the component currently in this file~~
1. ~~Create a MultiLineJoke component which will follow the same pattern as 1.~~
1. ~~Add logic in this component to randomly return either OneLineJoke or MultiLineJoke~~
1. ~~Break out big component into smaller components~~
1. ~~Style the fuck out of the app~~
1. Create and add app icon
1. Publish app
1. Create a KnockKnockJoke component with vibrate functionality
1. Create backend that will provide jokes, and voting functionality
1. Add voting functionality to app
1. Add joke history in "Info"


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

3. Start app on connected Android device

   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
